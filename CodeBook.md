# CodeBook.md
How does this file differ from the **Readme.md**?

(from forum)
1) I interpret README.md explains the process we used in deciding to select/use this data (we located/created data from such&such because ______, before we analyzed it we did such&such because ___).  Whereas, CodeBook.md explains the steps so anyone can repeat the process.  Can someone comment if this is close?

2) As spelled out in the requirements it is to be a .md (markdown) file.  I believe some discussion about codebook content is in the first week lectures and the DSS Community Site also provides some example codebooks.
