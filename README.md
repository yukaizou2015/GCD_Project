# README

(from forum)
1) I interpret README.md explains the process we used in deciding to select/use this data (we located/created data from such&such because ______, before we analyzed it we did such&such because ___).  

The repository contains several components:
1) tidy data sets (described below);
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis;
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called **CodeBook.md**. A **Readme.md** is also included with scripts.

This repository contains the work of the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data, and explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Two tidy data set:
* 1st_tidydataset.txt
* 2nd_tidydataset.txt
